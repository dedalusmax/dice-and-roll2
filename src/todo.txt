This is the list of things left open, after the initial (core) game has been developed.

TODO LIST:
--------------------------------
- saving game via local storage to browser
- end scene (after the whole game is finished)
- refactor styles (especially the colors used)
- fix position and scaling issues on different monitor displays
- optimize loading of assets in loading scene
- replace all var with lets in code
- uniform handling of background music and images
- support different types of locations (end, camp) not just battle
- create options for playing skirmish
- refactor new game and bestiary, since they use similar things
- add frames into map and mini map
- add controls to the map scene (exit)
